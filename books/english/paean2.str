Page_1: "Oh, my Karathian princess!
As a thief I will steal in the night,
and carry you off from the land of death!!

Ah for just one kiss, my darling!!
I am filled with madness for the taste
Of your lips, like two plump piglets!

Madness is approaching me, eating me!!
Alas, my lover, whose eyes ripple like water,
I can't bear this rift any longer!!!"
