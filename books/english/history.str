Page_1: "...was without doubt the essentia summa of the formula that Sadim had sought all these years. It was a large crystal of amaranth, of a shape somewhat akin to a long loaf. Its breadth was half an armspan, yet its weight much less than its size would indicate.

Heretofore Sadim's efforts at the transmutation had been in vain. But now, having at great expense obtained this crystal from a land far abroad, the formula was surely to be within his grasp.

Alas, fate, cruelest of gods, willed it not so. For that same year a great quake shook the earth, and the mountainside town in which Sadim dwelt collapsed into a deep ravine, burying the crystal and Sadim and all his work beneath the rubble. And so all the secrets he had learned are now lost to the world, forever.
