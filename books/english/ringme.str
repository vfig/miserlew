I told you miserable imbeciles to keep me supplied with wine!!

That means, when you hear me ring, you bring up a fresh bottle!! If we run out of bottles, bring up a whole barrel!!!

I should not have to waste my time explaining this to you cretinous creatures!! I don't want to hear your complaints, just keep the wine coming up!!!!"
