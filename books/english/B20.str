He has vast wealth - shipments of exotic goods and valuables to his tower are nearly constant - but he spends almost nothing in the markets and emporia of the district.

  Unsurprisingly, he isn't well loved by his neighbours. The gossips spread rumours of weird statues, and curses protecting the tower. The usual mumbo jumbo they dream up about any recluse. But his wealth of gold is undeniable, and I think it's about time some of it flowed in my direction."
