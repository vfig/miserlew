\"How, then, are the spirits of the dead not reft from us for eternity?\" asked the lover.

\"Because another Law stands also,\" replied Shet. \"For is it not so that all who have once lived will die before two coils of the sun? Do not answer: it is so, and all know it.\"

Shet laughed, and the sky darkened as the echoes resounded. \"You need not wait. Throw your belongings on the fire, and yourself after them! To travel early to the land of death is easily done.\""
